<a name="intro"/> <h2> Intro </h2> </a>
- This was my first project at école 42 SP after their basecamp (3 weeks of intense learning. Where I learned C and shell commands for the first time).
- The hardest part of the project was to get all the information from the basecamp and put together to create the library. I had to make sure that my base was good, so I could move forward to bigger projects.
- I learned about Libraries, Header Files, Makefile.
- Also I challenge myself to do the bonus and learned about Structs and Linked List.
- Because this was my first project, I used test create by other students to test my functions. So I could focus on learning the basics first and create a strong base.
- The functions that use malloc don´t free the memmory so it is important to remember to use free after using any of them.

<a name="goal"/> <h2> 🎯 Goal </h2> </a>
- This first project is used to reinforce basic concepts learned during the basecamp of école 42:
  - Basic concepts like variables, function, pointers and memmory allocation.
  - It is also an introduction to concept of Libraries, Header files, Makefile, Structs and Linked Lists.

###### *42 changes the projects from time to time, and the test keep being updated to follow it. So this project may be outdated for the tests.
